## Configuring Bifrost

You **must configure** bifrost before you can run it.

Bifrost requires a configuration file, `config.yaml`.

This file contains the essential settings needed to run the server. For example,
the IP and MAC address used by the server, and a list of the Zigbee2Mqtt servers
to connect to.

When using the Home Assistant Add-on, the file must be available inside the
docker container as `/config/bifrost/config.yaml`, which means you have to put
it here:

    /usr/share/hassio/homeassistant/bifrost

### If you have the popular "File Editor" add-on installed, do this:

  1. Open "File Editor"
  2. Go to the top level
  3. Create directory `bifrost` (*lowercase*)
  4. Inside that directory, create `config.yaml`

## Configuration example

Here's an example, for a server listening on `10.12.0.20/24`, with a Zigbee2Mqtt
server running on `10.0.0.100`:

```yaml
bridge:
  name: Bifrost
  mac: 00:11:22:33:44:55
  ipaddress: 10.12.0.20
  netmask: 255.255.255.0
  gateway: 10.12.0.1
  timezone: Europe/Copenhagen

z2m:
  server1:
    url: ws://10.0.0.100:8080
```

Please adjust this as needed. Particularly, make **sure** the "mac:" field
matches the mac address on the network interface you want to serve requests from.

For details, see the [configuration reference](https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/blob/master/doc/config-reference.md).

This mac address if used to generate a self-signed certificate, so the Hue App
will recognize this as a "real" Hue Bridge. If the mac address is incorrect,
this will not work. [How to find your mac address](https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/blob/master/doc/how-to-find-mac-linux.md).

# F.A.Q

## Will Bifrost work without Zigbee2Mqtt?

Not in the near future. Bifrost is closely integrated with Zigbee2Mqtt, to provide good, reliable performance.

Development is underway to be able to support multiple types of backends at some future
point, but only the z2m backend is being developed.

## Will Bifrost be able to use my switches / motion sensors?

Currently, no. However, Zigbee2Mqtt is able to use these, and it's
absolutely possible to use such devices via e.g. Home Assistant, even while
using Bifrost at the same time to control your lights.

We hope to support switches and motion sensors in a future Bifrost release.

## Will Bifrost ever support the Hue (HDMI) Sync Box, or true Entertainment Mode?

In the future, yes!

The Bifrost project has acheived several breakthroughs in reverse-engineering
the proprietary Hue Entertainment Mode protocols. This work has been made
possible by your donations, which have been invested in necessary equipment.
