# Changelog

This is the DEVELOPMENT TEST VERSION (not the stable release version).

The development version contains new, experimental and/or incomplete features.

It is intended for advanced users, who want all the features, even if they are
not quite done yet.

The dev version is based on the latest stable version, and includes whatever is
in development at the time.

# Changes

## 2025-03-02: `duvholt/state-version-fix`

Use `get_software_version` when patching bridge version.

This fixes a bug where the hue application disconnects periodically, after a version update.

## 2025-02-13: `FabioCanavarro/Add-Docker-Pull-Method`

README: Add Docker pull installation method

## 2025-02-13: `waywardmonkeys/reduce-typo-count`

Reduce typo count - big thanks to @waywardmonkeys

## 2025-02-04: `chrivers/gradient-support`

Experimental support for gradient light strips!

Helped by generous donations from the community, I have been able to purchase a
hue gradient light strip.

After much work, this is now in a mostly-working state.

Support for this is pretty involved, and requires somewhat complicated math to
do color space conversion between XYZ, XYY and RGB.

Some artifacts are expected, and so far this has only been tested with a single
hue led strip, the LCX005 ("Hue Light Strip for PC").

Feedback very welcome. Please let me know if this works for you, and which
lights you have tried this on :)

## 2025-02-04: `chrivers/json-extractor-workaround`

This fixes a recurring problem with poorly-implemented client programs (i.e, not
the Hue app or Home Assistant).

Programs like Free@Home, Hue Essentials and OnSwitch do not consistently send
the correct `Content-Type` headers, causing Bifrost to reject their API requests:

 - https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/issues/70
 - https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/issues/69
 - https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/issues/25

With this change, Bifrost ignores the Content-Type header, and tries to decode
Json whenever that is the expected input format.

## 2025-02-01: `FabioCanavarro/add-build-essential-note`

README: Added build-essential note and Bash syntax highlighting for shell commands

## 2025-01-29: `duvholt/device-with-slash`

Christian Duvholt is back with another improvement. This merge request adds
support for Zigbee2Mqtt device names with a "/" in them.

## 2025-01-29: `chrivers/zigbee-format-doc`

The Bifrost project achieved a breakthrough in understanding the
manufacturer-specific Zigbee protocols used for Philips Hue lights. These are
required for proper gradient strip support, and have now been fully documented
for the first time ever!

## 2025-01-26: `duvholt/sse-resume`

Christian Duvholt fixed a long-standing annoyance in Bifrost, by making event
stream able to resume from timestamp.

This improves how quickly the hue app is updating after short breaks (i.e,
turning off your phone screen for a short while).

## 2025-01-25: Internal device database

Bifrost now has a built-in table of product data for known hue devices, allowing
it to emulate hue bridges more precisely.

## 2025-01-25: Fix for iHueConnect app for iPhone

Discord users Alexa and Peter Miller reported an error with the iPhone app "iHue Connect".

After some research, it was discovered that iHue Connect, for unknown reasons,
sends an invalid api request, before proceeding to start.

By emulating the bridge response to the junk request, the app accepts Bifrost as
a real hue bridge, thus making the app work.

## 2025-01-19: Zigbee2mqtt version 2.x support

Zigbee2mqtt version 2.x was released recently. It brings a number of changes,
including stricter requirements for connecting to the websocket.

This version of bifrost has support for z2m 2.x.

Please let us know how it works for you!

## 2025-01-19: `duvholt/actions-permissions-fix`

Re-add GitHub Actions permissions block

## 2025-01-19: Experimental support for `aarch64` architecture

Thanks to a [contribution from
@duvholt](https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/pull/54) bifrost docker images are
now available for `aarch64`. This is the 64-bit ARM architecture, used by
Raspberry Pi and many other Single Board Computers.

Please let us know how Bifrost for ARM works for you!

## 2025-01-17: Hue API model and emulation improvements

Improved compatibility and features based on these branches:

 - `duvholt/arm64` + `duvholt/actions-permissions-fix`
 - `chrivers/device-update`
 - `chrivers/normalization`
 - `chrivers/z2m-fixes3`
 - `chrivers/z2m-fixes2`

## 2025-01-17: `chrivers/normalization`

Chrivers/normalization

## 2025-01-17: Multiple bug fixes for rare edge cases

Several users reported edge cases in parsing the z2m output. Some of these

Bugs fixed:

 - [Issue 56](https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/issues/56) Event loop broke: invalid type: integer 30, expected a string
 - [Issue 51](https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/issues/51) Failed to parse critical z2m bridge message on [bridge/devices]
 - [Issue 47](https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/issues/47) Possible API breakage with z2m version 2.x

## 2025-01-15: Self update

Bifrost now queries the hue firmware update servers (like the hue app does) to learn about the newest hue version number.

This branch implements all the necessary support, and spawns a new server task (background job) that tries to fetch the newest version number every 24 hours.

Once a new version number is found, the state database is automatically patched.

In my local test, the version number was successfully updated as soon as Bifrost started.

The log output looks like this:

```
bifrost[104186]: bifrost::server::updater: Firmware update information expired. Fetching..
bifrost[104186]: reqwest::connect: starting new connection: https://firmware.meethue.com/
bifrost[104186]: hyper_util::client::legacy::connect::dns: resolve; host=firmware.meethue.com
bifrost[104186]: hyper_util::client::legacy::connect::http: connecting to 34.120.72.74:443
bifrost[104186]: hyper_util::client::legacy::connect::http: connected to 34.120.72.74:443
bifrost[104186]: hyper_util::client::legacy::pool: pooling idle connection for ("https", firmware.meethue.com)
```

later that second, we see this:

```
bifrost[104186]: bifrost::model::state: Bridge device 37859e65-fdef-5965-8858-bbaef6cf47b8 on older firmware 1.60.1960149090. Updating to 1.68.0
bifrost[104186]: bifrost::model::state: Bridge device 72ca59bc-b9e3-578c-8a7d-e2ce07f3604c on older firmware 1.60.1960149090. Updating to 1.68.0
```

This all happened automatically, and the hue app worked again üëç
