# Changelog

This is the DEVELOPMENT TEST VERSION (not the stable release version).

The development version contains new, experimental and/or incomplete features.

It is intended for advanced users, who want all the features, even if they are
not quite done yet.

The dev version is based on the latest stable version, and includes whatever is
in development at the time.

## 2025-01-26:

Experimental support for gradient light strips!

Helped by generous donations from the community, I have been able to purchase a
hue gradient light strip.

After much work, this is now in a mostly-working state.

Support for this is pretty involved, and requires somewhat complicated math to
do color space conversion between XYZ, XYY and RGB.

Some artifacts are expected, and so far this has only been tested with a single
hue led strip, the LCX005 ("Hue Light Strip for PC").

Feedback very welcome. Please let me know if this works for you, and which
lights you have tried this on :)

## Stable version:

Please see the
[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost-hassio/blob/master/bifrost/CHANGELOG.md)
for the stable version, which has an extensive list of changes from the previous
version.
