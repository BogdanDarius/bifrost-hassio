# Bifrost Bridge

Bifrost enables you to emulate a Philips Hue Bridge to control lights, groups
and scenes from [Zigbee2Mqtt](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/).

## Installation guide

  1. Install Bifrost Add-on
  2. Configure Bifrost (see next sections)
  3. Start Bifrost Add-on

## Configuring Bifrost

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You **must configure** bifrost before you can run it.

Bifrost requires a configuration file, `config.yaml`.

This file contains the essential settings needed to run the server. For example,
the IP and MAC address used by the server, and a list of the Zigbee2Mqtt servers
to connect to.

When using the Home Assistant Add-on, the file must be available inside the
docker container as `/config/bifrost/config.yaml`, which means you have to put
it here:

    /usr/share/hassio/homeassistant/bifrost

### If you have the popular "File Editor" add-on installed, do this:

  1. Open "File Editor"
  2. Go to the top level
  3. Create directory `bifrost` (*lowercase*)
  4. Inside that directory, create `config.yaml`

## Configuration example

Here's an example, for a server listening on `10.12.0.20/24`, with a Zigbee2Mqtt
server running on `10.0.0.100`:

```yaml
bridge:
  name: Bifrost
  mac: 00:11:22:33:44:55
  ipaddress: 10.12.0.20
  netmask: 255.255.255.0
  gateway: 10.12.0.1
  timezone: Europe/Copenhagen

z2m:
  server1:
    url: ws://10.0.0.100:8080
```

Please adjust this as needed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Make sure** the "mac:" field matches the mac address on the network interface you want to serve requests from.

For details, see the [configuration reference](https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/blob/master/doc/config-reference.md).

This mac address if used to generate a self-signed certificate, so the Hue App
will recognize this as a "real" Hue Bridge. If the mac address is incorrect,
this will not work. [How to find your mac address](https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/blob/master/doc/how-to-find-mac-linux.md).

# F.A.Q

## Will Bifrost work without Zigbee2Mqtt?

Not in the near future. Bifrost is closely integrated with Zigbee2Mqtt, to provide good, reliable performance.

Development is underway to be able to support multiple types of backends at some future
point, but only the z2m backend is being developed.

## Will Bifrost be able to use my switches / motion sensors?

Currently, no. However, Zigbee2Mqtt is able to use these, and it's
absolutely possible to use such devices via e.g. Home Assistant, even while
using Bifrost at the same time to control your lights.

We hope to support switches and motion sensors in a future Bifrost release.

## Will Bifrost ever support the Hue (HDMI) Sync Box, or true Entertainment Mode?

In the future, yes!

The Bifrost project has acheived several breakthroughs in reverse-engineering
the proprietary Hue Entertainment Mode protocols. This work has been made
possible by your donations, which have been invested in necessary equipment.

# Donors

I would like to personally thank the people who have helped this project financially.

Your support has resulted in major breakthroughs, and we all get to enjoy the results.

The following people have donated a total of 25â‚¬ or more:
  - Alexa & Peter Miller
  - Modem-Tones
  - Rohan Kapoor
  - thk

In particular, I would like to thank Rohan Kapoor for his very generous donation, which
covered the cost of a Hue Sync Box!


# Changelog (10 most recent changes)

### 2025-03-11: `chrivers/the-big-backend-refactor`

The Big Backend Refactor

Rework the infrastructure of Bifrost, to make a clean separation of Zigbee2Mqtt-specific code into a z2m backend module.

At the same time, a new common interface is defined, that backends must implement.

This opens the door for hypothetically supporting multiple types of backends at some future time. However, Zigbee2Mqtt is still the only supported for now.

### 2025-03-11: `chrivers/axum-fixes`

Upgrade to Axum 0.8, and clean up dependencies to avoid unnecessary/duplicate crates.

## 2025-03-02: `duvholt/state-version-fix`

Use `get_software_version` when patching bridge version.

This fixes a bug where the hue application disconnects periodically, after a version update.

## 2025-02-13: `FabioCanavarro/Add-Docker-Pull-Method`

README: Add Docker pull installation method

## 2025-02-13: `waywardmonkeys/reduce-typo-count`

Reduce typo count - big thanks to @waywardmonkeys

## 2025-02-04: `chrivers/gradient-support`

Experimental support for gradient light strips!

Helped by generous donations from the community, I have been able to purchase a
hue gradient light strip.

After much work, this is now in a mostly-working state.

Support for this is pretty involved, and requires somewhat complicated math to
do color space conversion between XYZ, XYY and RGB.

Some artifacts are expected, and so far this has only been tested with a single
hue led strip, the LCX005 ("Hue Light Strip for PC").

Feedback very welcome. Please let me know if this works for you, and which
lights you have tried this on :)

## 2025-02-04: `chrivers/json-extractor-workaround`

This fixes a recurring problem with poorly-implemented client programs (i.e, not
the Hue app or Home Assistant).

Programs like Free@Home, Hue Essentials and OnSwitch do not consistently send
the correct `Content-Type` headers, causing Bifrost to reject their API requests:

 - https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/issues/70
 - https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/issues/69
 - https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/issues/25

With this change, Bifrost ignores the Content-Type header, and tries to decode
Json whenever that is the expected input format.

## 2025-02-01: `FabioCanavarro/add-build-essential-note`

README: Added build-essential note and Bash syntax highlighting for shell commands

## 2025-01-29: `duvholt/device-with-slash`

Christian Duvholt is back with another improvement. This merge request adds
support for Zigbee2Mqtt device names with a "/" in them.

## 2025-01-29: `chrivers/zigbee-format-doc`

The Bifrost project achieved a breakthrough in understanding the
manufacturer-specific Zigbee protocols used for Philips Hue lights. These are
required for proper gradient strip support, and have now been fully documented
for the first time ever!

# Now on Ko-fi! Donations welcome :-)

Developing software for the hue ecosystem is a fun, but pretty expensive hobby.

If you would like to toss a few dollaridoos in the hat, I've set up a Ko-fi accont:

[![Link to Ko-Fi donation page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrivers/bifrost-hassio/refs/heads/master/kofi.png)](https://ko-fi.com/L4L819GOTY)
