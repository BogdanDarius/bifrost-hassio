## 2025-01-19: Experimental support for `aarch64` architecture

Thanks to a [contribution from
@duvholt](https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost/pull/54) bifrost docker images are
now available for `aarch64`. This is the 64-bit ARM architecture, used by
Raspberry Pi and many other Single Board Computers.

Please let us know how Bifrost for ARM works for you!
