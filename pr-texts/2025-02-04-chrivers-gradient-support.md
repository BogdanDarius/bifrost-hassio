Experimental support for gradient light strips!

Helped by generous donations from the community, I have been able to purchase a
hue gradient light strip.

After much work, this is now in a mostly-working state.

Support for this is pretty involved, and requires somewhat complicated math to
do color space conversion between XYZ, XYY and RGB.

Some artifacts are expected, and so far this has only been tested with a single
hue led strip, the LCX005 ("Hue Light Strip for PC").

Feedback very welcome. Please let me know if this works for you, and which
lights you have tried this on :)
