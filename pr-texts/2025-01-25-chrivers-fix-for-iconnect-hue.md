## 2025-01-25: Fix for iHueConnect app for iPhone

Discord users Alexa and Peter Miller reported an error with the iPhone app "iHue Connect".

After some research, it was discovered that iHue Connect, for unknown reasons,
sends an invalid api request, before proceeding to start.

By emulating the bridge response to the junk request, the app accepts Bifrost as
a real hue bridge, thus making the app work.
